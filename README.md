# Zona de Consolidacao Expert Advisor

This is an Expert Advisor (EA) code for the MetaTrader 5 platform. The EA is designed to identify and analyze consolidation zones in the price chart and generate trading signals based on these zones.

## How it Works

The EA uses historical price data to calculate consolidation zones. A consolidation zone is a range of prices where the market is trading in a sideways or range-bound fashion. These zones are identified based on a specified price interval.

The main functions of the EA are as follows:

1. **OnInit()**: This function is called during the EA initialization process. Any necessary initialization code can be added here.

2. **OnDeinit()**: This function is called when the EA is being deinitialized. Any necessary deinitialization code can be added here.

3. **OnTick()**: This function is called on every tick of the price chart. It performs the main analysis and trading logic of the EA. 

   - It first calculates the consolidation zone using the function `CalculateConsolidationZone()`.
   
   - It then highlights the most significant consolidation zone on the chart using the function `HighlightConsolidationZone()`.
   
   - It checks for entry and exit signals based on the consolidation zone using the functions `IsEntrySignal()` and `IsExitSignal()`.
   
   - If there is an entry signal, it triggers the function `EnterTrade()` to enter a trade.
   
   - If there is an exit signal, it triggers the function `ExitTrade()` to exit the trade.

4. **CalculateConsolidationZone()**: This function calculates the consolidation zone based on the historical price data. The parameters include the symbol, timeframe, and the price interval.

5. **HighlightConsolidationZone()**: This function highlights the consolidation zone on the chart. The consolidation zone value is passed as a parameter.

6. **IsEntrySignal()**: This function checks for an entry signal based on the consolidation zone. It returns true if there is an entry signal, otherwise false.

7. **IsExitSignal()**: This function checks for an exit signal based on the consolidation zone. It returns true if there is an exit signal, otherwise false.

8. **EnterTrade()**: This function is responsible for entering a trade. Any necessary code for trade entry can be added here.

9. **ExitTrade()**: This function is responsible for exiting a trade. Any necessary code for trade exit can be added here.
